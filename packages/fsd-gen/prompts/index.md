# fsd-generator: AI Agent Prompt Library

Welcome. You are an AI Agent assigned to work on a Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) project. This library contains all the instructions you need to use the `fsd-gen` CLI tool effectively to scaffold, maintain, and verify your code.

## Start Here
- [**System Guide**](./system-guide.md): Understand your core mandate, FSD layering principles, and the requirement to prefer CLI commands over manual code generation.
- [**Agent Roles & Relations**](./agent-roles.md): Learn how specialized agent roles (Architect, Developer, Validator) collaborate to ensure architectural quality.
- [**Interaction Flow**](./interaction-flow.md): Follow the standard 4-phase sequence (Discovery, Strategy, Execution, Verification) for reliable code production.

## Capability Guides
- [**Generating Components & Slices**](./generate-component.md): Master the `generate` command for creating atomic FSD slices and UI components.
- [**Using Presets**](./use-preset.md): High-level guide for vertical scaffolding of complex business features using pre-defined patterns.
- [**Reverse Engineering**](./reverse-engineering.md): Learn the workflow for extracting reusable presets from existing high-quality code.

## Quick Reference
- [**CLI Cheat Sheet**](./all-commands.md): Instant lookup for all `fsd-gen` commands, arguments, and options.
